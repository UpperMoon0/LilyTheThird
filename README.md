# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a desktop application built using Python and PyQt5. It features two main tabs: a Chat tab and a Discord tab. The Chat tab allows users to interact with a chatbot that can translate responses into Japanese, convert them to speech using Edge TTS, and play them. The Discord tab integrates a Discord bot that can respond to messages. The application also includes a short-term memory feature for prompt history and a long-term memory feature in the form of a knowledge graph.
